# Optimized TimeTable Generator
Generating a Time Table for all streams, implimented in python.
## An Introduction
TimeTable scheduling is a typical problem that appears to be a tedious job in every academic institute once or twice a year. In earlier days, time table scheduling was done manually with a single person or some group involved in task of scheduling it manually, which takes a lot of effort and time. Planning timetables is one of the most complex and error-prone applications.<br />
**Input data:** For each class we need classes per week, number of subjects, number of sections, data on number of precceding holidays.<br />
**Output:** Gives the efficient scheduled timetable for all sections or branches.<br />
The main objective of this project is to make an efficient time table based on factors like 
- [x] Lecturer/Teacher avilability
- [x] Scheduling based on preceeding holidays
- [x] Flexibility for sections of a same class
