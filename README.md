# Efficient-Time-Table
This project is about making a suitable time table for all the sections and classes based on various factors.
## An Introduction
The main objective of the website is to check and display the calorie consumption of the user through out the day.To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn.Any excess calories you eat will be stored as fat, and consistently eating more than you burn will cause weight gain over time.In theory, this sound simple.However, managing your food intake in the modern food environment can be tricky.Calorie counting is one way to tackle this problem, and is commonly used for weight loss. Also the website suggests a health calorie intake based on various factors (BMR).This website also provides a pie chart to distinguh the amount of protiens and carbohydrates consumed by the user.
